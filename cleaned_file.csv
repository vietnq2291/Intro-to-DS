We spent 2 nights here this week, celebrating our wedding anniversary. The welcome was professional and warm. The room was a great size but the views were just incredible. We stayed in 2101 and the views watching the sun rise and sun set over London were wonderful. Drinks prices in the onsite restaurant were steep, but as expected in this kind of establishment. The breakfast was delicious and service very prompt. However our favourite part was the pool and gym. We went both days we were there and were lucky enough to be the only ones using it both times. I have nothing negative to say, it was a perfect way to spend a few nights away relaxing and celebrating.Rooms5.0Service5.0Location5.0Hotel highlightsLuxury · Great view · Romantic · QuietWalkabilityWell connected with 3 TFL lines all within 10 minutes.

We stayed for 2 nights and we did not have hot water on the top floor. Let me rephrase: we did not even have water, as the pressure was so low that we could not even flush the toilet or brush our teeth. The receptionist told us that this happens when the students on the second floor use all the water. We tried also during the night, we had to let the water run for 30 minutes to have lukewarm water, so basically we did not shower.
On the second day in the morning, we did not have water at all. In the night, we had hot water but while showering, it was being cut off and when it came back it became boiling, with no possibility to moderate it towards colder.
The staff of the morning shift was rude and unpleasant. The girl on the afternoon shift was helpful and we thank her for her help, however, her male colleague was scrolling on his phone and completely ignored us.
The funny thing is that in the reviews on Google, the property replies in the same way to all comments, which are basically a) rude staff and b) no water. One could assume that they would have fixed these two but they do not seem to care. Positive: The beds were comfortable, the location was safe and well-connected, and the room was quiet (top floor).

Die Sauberkeit fand ich okay und unser Bad war in Ordnung. Ich habe in einem 6er-Schlafsaal geschlafen bzw. habe versucht, zu schlafen. Und hier fängt die Misere auch schon an: Es war unfassbar warm im Zimmer (ca. 10 Grad mehr als draußen) und, was ich schlimmer fand, unendlich stickig. Ich hatte das oberste Bett und hatte das Gefühl, nicht atmen zu können. Ich bin tatsächlich mitten in der Nacht in ein anderes Hostel umgezogen, da Schlafen in diesem Zimmer unmöglich war. Ich bin eigentlich nicht zimperlich, aber so unfassbar schlechte Luft habe ich noch nie erlebt. Für die zweite Nacht wurde mir netterweise ein tieferes Bett zugeteilt. Hier konnte ich einigermaßen schlafen. Daher auch 2 Sterne für den Service statt einem. Ansonsten hat es die Angestellten nicht wirklich interessiert, was man für Probleme hat.
Da schon mehrere Leute die Probleme mit Luft und Wärme geschildert haben, verstehe ich nicht, warum sich das Hostel nicht darum bemüht, dass man wenigstens die Fenster weiter öffnen kann.
(Translated by Google)
I struggled to give two stars instead of one because I've experienced worse (in terms of furnishings etc.). I thought the cleanliness was okay and our bathroom was fine. I slept or tried to sleep in a 6-person dormitory. And this is where the misery begins: It was incredibly warm in the room (about 10 degrees more than outside) and, what I found worse, incredibly stuffy. I had the top bunk and felt like I couldn't breathe. I actually moved to another hostel in the middle of the night because sleeping in that room was impossible. I'm actually not squeamish, but I've never experienced such incredibly bad air. For the second night I was kindly given a deeper bed. I was able to get some sleep here. Hence 2 stars for the service instead of one. Otherwise, the employees weren't really interested in what problems you had.
Since several people have already described the problems with air and heat, I don't understand why the hostel doesn't make an effort to at least open the windows more.Rooms1.0Service2.0Location3.0Report reviewResponse from the ownera month agoHello,

The location is amazing, it’s literally a minute away from Hyde Park and multiple tube stations so you can get anywhere quickly and easily. You can check in until late and the hostel doesn’t close over night so you can be flexible with your plans.
I stayed for 2 nights, in a 6 bed female only room with an en-suite bathroom and everything was clean and I felt safe. The rooms are small, but there is enough luggage storage and drawers under the beds. The beds are not very comfortable haha but I would say that’s normal for a hostel. There’s a little noise from the street at night but nothing some earplugs can’t solve. You get two power outlets, curtains and reading light by your bed, very useful! Wifi connection was very good in my room.
I didn’t get breakfast at the hostel and I didn’t use the kitchen either, basically only came to my room late in the evening to go to sleep for the two nights I spent there.

We stayed in a family room which was spacious by London standards and very well appointed. Super clean and comfortable with a lot of great amenities. We appreciated the thorough housekeeping service every day, and the in-room Nespresso machine was a great touch. The only disappointment was the total lack of a view as our room overlooked a central courtyard. However, it was not a major problem for us as we were out sightseeing all day. Beds are extremely comfortable and our room was very quiet so we all slept well. From a family standpoint, the only thing missing at this hotel is a swimming pool.
We did try the hotel breakfast and there was a nice buffet as well as a la carte options. The dining room is nice and bright with a nice view of the surrounding area.
Service was always pleasant and courteous. While we were unable to check in a few hours early as we had hoped, staff did watch our bags while we went out.
The hotel location is convenient in the sense that it is close to multiple underground lines with easy access to Central London. However, it is in the somewhat sterile business area of Canary Wharf which is perhaps a bit less interesting for visitors. That said, there are some enjoyable walks, shops and restaurants nearby.

Nestled there, the cozy embrace of comfort was a warm hug from hospitality heaven.
But, oh, the bathroom saga! The cloth shower curtain waltzed straight out of a time warp, making me cringe like I'd stumbled onto a forgotten '80s dance floor. At just under £300, I am not sure if I expected a shower curtain? Maybe with a bit more pizzazz and a lot less time-travel potential.
Will I rekindle this love affair? Well, if Marriott can bid farewell to the curtain calamity, consider me checking in again. Until then, it's me, Marriott – we need to talk about your vintage taste in bathroom decor. #ShowerCurtainChronicles

Not the worst I’ve seen but every single employee I dealt with seemed SO annoyed that they had to check me in or help with anything. Felt like that’s just how the whole establishment decided to treat people. No info on how the place works just here’s your key. Thin walls/noisy- bring headphones or ear plugs. The main reason I booked this one is because they have curtains on all the bunks! A must for me. Rooms are okay, no ventilation in ours. It was cold outside but hot stinky in the room. Mostly clean. They could use some better signage, it’s really hard to find if you come after holland park closes. (There’s a tiny, barely marked gate that’s the only way to get in) Breakfast is tiny with very few options for £8. They charge a “corkage fee” if you want to eat your own breakfast or snacks or drinks which is ridiculous considering their limited options. I’d suggest a hostel with a kitchen and less “nickel and dime-y”. I definitely wouldn’t stay again. Location is pretty great. 10 min walk to trains. Inside/Outside of 2 beautiful parks- one more recreational and one full of flowers and beauty. The hostel does feel safe (other than the walk to get there at night alone feels sketchy and secluded).

There was 9 lockers, but one had a lock on (like it’s been like that for a while) so when we went to leave we had to stuff 2 bags in one locker because all the other lockers were been used. So not enough lockers for everyone. The tiny bathroom (toilet area) was always dirty. The trash was always full. There is another bathroom at the end of the hallway, but we did not know this until the day we were leaving. Difficult to shower because you have to leave your stuff outside on the sink which is always wet. Not sure how they clean the place, maybe with a hose? Because the whole room was wet when we went to shower in the morning, the walls, the sink, the mirror… imposible to brush you teeth without getting your clothes all wet. I mean what the h? If you wanted to put your close anywhere you could not, because everything was wet. And apparently whoever cleaned did not cared to dry it.
The place needs a good clean. The hallway, the access stairs needs to be deeply cleaned. You have to go trough the bar to get to the rooms every time. No big deal, but keep that in mind.

I've looked into booking one before where it was more like £55 which is a little steep for a hostel but if there's rooms for 30-40 consider this place!
The bed was simple but comfy, the room was clean, and the capsule has charging ports and a colour changing light which is a cool touch. The room with the capsules has its own bathroom with toilet cubicles, showers, sinks and free hairdryers, plus a locker for each pod. The showers each have a small area with a shelf before you get in, to put your clothes on. Much more convenient than some other places I've been to where you have to balance your stuff in a pile in the sink or put it on the dirty floor. As I left a staff member was scrubbing everything down really thoroughly and it showed, the bathrooms were really nice and clean. The lockers don't have locks though so bring your own if you wanna leave anything valuable in.
The bar downstairs was blasting club music all night, but they've thought of that too and give you free ear plugs on your pillow, which I really appreciate. Didn't actually try the bar because I went out the night I stayed, but it seemed modern and fun. Good place to meet new people I'm sure.
You unlock the doors with an app, it was much more convenient than a key card that you can lose, you just gotta make sure to keep your phone charged properly.  The lady that checked me in was great and explained how to use the app and where everything was.

the toilets aren’t working, the showers are always cold or are having mood swings. The bathrooms were always dirty with weird spots on sink, toilet and shower.
The rooms have clearly not really been cleaned before our stay and haven’t been in quite some time (dust&dirt in all corners and on all surfaces). 3 of our beds had old (dirty) bedding on them.
My friends bag suddenly went missing and when we managed to get it back from reception it had some new shampoo in it, my friend left that bag in our room our entire stay long… how that bag got down to reception is a mystery to this day.
The bar is so. loud. we stayed on the second floor and were able to hear everything plus the loud noises from outside since there also is a pub next to the hostel. But still if we were to be a bit louder we would have had to pay a fine???
THE WORST was when one of my classmates noticed that the toast that was being served for breakfast had MOLD growing on it.

I love hostels but this was by in far, the worst I've stayed at. I'm not sure how anyone could categorize this as a party hostel either. It was extremely anti-social as there are no common areas, no coordinated events, etc. They have a ""chill room"" that can fit about 6 people, and they have a partnership with a bar crawl but it's just a bar crawl that you go to on your own that is fairly far from the hostel (20-30 minute tube ride)- not one where you all originate at the hostel together and make friends in as you go through it all together. They have a bar that is ""connected"" to it, but you still have to exit the building and go through the bar entrance.
The hostel is so massive and sleeps tons of people that it is constantly busy in the front desk, bathrooms, etc, but still not in a way that facilitates conversations and people making friends.
Towels cost money to use and there is no free luggage storage- two other cons.
The hostel was decently clean- not amazing but not horrifying either. They desperately need changing rooms or something, but that isn't just unique to this hostel.

The location is 5 stars if you're looking to explore the city, St Katherine Docks are behind the hotel with plenty of food outlets as well.

The hotel though is in need of serious maintenance. The heating didn’t work so I was given a plug-in radiator, ok but the shower didn’t work in the morning which is my biggest peeve with a hotel stay. Overall the room was tired.
Also I was awaken at 2:45 by a fire alarm, perhaps not their fault but it kinda summed up the stay.

Excellent location from which to walk along the riverside to the city centre or enjoy a night out in The City. Tower Hill tube is an 8 minute walk from the hotel.
The hotel service was excellent and friendly at all times, the cleanliness of the rooms was very good and the receptionists charming. We would have liked the dining room staff to control the rude people more and avoid disturbing other guests.
The breakfast was always well prepared, although regarding the variety of sweet, fruits and savoury dishes, it was almost the same everyday. But overall everything was good and very tasty.

Dann steckte man uns in ein super winziges Zimmer, wo ein offensichtlich ausgebautes Bett einfach zugestellt wurde. Man hatte keinerlei Möglichkeiten seine Koffer abzulegen so klein war es dort. Abgesehen von der mangelnden Reinheit des Zimmers wo sich in einer Ecke im Badezimmer fremde Haare befanden und auf dem Bettlaken ebenfalls. Das Frühstück war sehr ernüchternd. Es gab keinerlei Belag oder frisches Gemüse zum Frühstück. Nach nur einer Nacht wollten wir definitiv nicht weiter in diesem Zimmer bzw. am besten gar nicht mehr in dem Hotel  bleiben und haben drum gebeten uns entweder ein großeres Zimmer zu geben oder uns in einer der anderen Hotels umzubuchen. Das war anscheinend nicht möglich deshalb erstattete uns die Managerin immerhin unsere restlichen bezahlten Nächte. Das war allerdings auch das einzig positive an dem Hotel! Definitiv nicht nochmal !!!

Don't even know where to start. Incompetence to the power of 10! Had to pay 10 pounds extra because we wanted to check in 50 minutes beforehand with 2 children and a lot of luggage. Then we were put in a super tiny room where a bed that had obviously been removed was simply placed. There was no way to put your suitcases down, it was so small there. Apart from the lack of cleanliness of the room where there was strange hair in a corner of the bathroom and also on the bed sheet. The breakfast was very sobering. There were no toppings or fresh vegetables for breakfast. After just one night, we definitely didn't want to stay in this room any longer or, ideally, not in the hotel at all, so we asked either to be given a larger room or to be rebooked in one of the other hotels. Apparently that wasn't possible, so the manager refunded us the remaining nights we paid for. However, that was the only positive thing about the hotel!

I stayed for business on a day when there was nothing on at the Arena and so the hotel was almost empty. You would think this translated into better service - nope!
When I arrived and tried to check in, the receptionist got half way through checking me in (between looking at his phone) before a Manager walked over and, without acknowledging me at all, told the receiptionist to go to the bar as people were waiting. The Manager then proceeded to ask me all the same questions *again* before I got checked in.
The room was up to the usual standard of Premier Inn - no complaints at all.
Breakfast was poor for a Premier Inn. Most of the food was cold (I went at 8am so wasn't exactly late) and I could never seem to find someone to ask for help with I couldn't find something.

The good bits: rooms a typical P.I rooms , quality beds, decent pillows , enough room, decent bathroom , TV etc and everything works. The location is this places best feature being minutes walk from Wembley arena or stadium or wembley park tube ( jubilee line) to get to central London.  Now the not so good bits, which would be so easy to fix. Firstly the check in machines weren't working properly so everyone had to queue to see a member of staff. In the lobby the savoury snack machine was switched off with no sign saying it was out of order or when it might be fixed and the cold drinks machine was charging more for still water than inside wembley arena at 2.85 for a small bottle.  There is scant information about the restaurant dining times on the website, the app or the in room menu, the only way to find this info out is by visiting reception and joining the queue checking in.  The menu says about in room dining, but you can't actually order, you have to go to the restaurant , order, then come back down to collect it.....it's 2023 how hard is it to have an menu app you can order food from which you can then collect when it's ready.

Our room was so-so. The bathroom sink plughole was disgusting, the remote control looked like it had never been cleaned and there was an odd splatter stain (bleach, maybe?) on one side of the bed base. The carpet didn't look great and I didn't feel comfortable walking around our room without shoes on.
The bed was slightly softer than I'm used to but was very comfortable.
We were not impressed with the Thyme restaurant as when we were eating our starter in the evening of our stay, our mains were brought out. I refused to accept it and sent it back to the kitchen until we had finished our starters.
The meal deal which included evening meal plus breakfast for £24.99 was good.

I recently stayed at this hotel for the second time for our visit in London. I cannot speak highly enough about our experience. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by the lovely staff who checked us in and provided us with the information we needed for our stay.
The location of the hotel is fabulous as it is located In the heart of Kensington close to restaurants, bars, shops, public transport and popular attractions such as Hyde park which is only a walking distance.
Hotel facilities are fairly good compared to the price and it definitely has everything you need from a hotel as well as high-speed WiFi which is important.
The environment was very nice and friendly and the area was a super safe and quiet at night which was very important for us.

The concierge who greeted me upon check-in was very nice and provided a warm welcome. It was a pleasant way to start my stay, and I appreciated the friendly demeanor.
However, there were several aspects of the hotel that left much to be desired. Firstly, I found the hotel's policy of not allowing guests to take the key card out of the premises to be quite unusual. It was inconvenient to have to hand over the key card every time I left the hotel, and it felt like an unnecessary restriction.
The room I was assigned, room 26, was a small single room that felt incredibly cramped, almost resembling a prison cell. The size was truly disappointing and made it challenging to move around comfortably. Additionally, I noticed that the walls were marked, which gave the room a somewhat neglected appearance.
Furthermore, the lack of cleanliness was evident in the room. The shelves were dusty, which made me question the overall cleanliness and attention to detail in maintaining the accommodations. Additionally, the hot water in the bathroom sink did not work, which was an inconvenience for basic hygiene needs.
The layout of the bathroom was also quite problematic. I had to literally climb over the toilet to access the shower, which was an awkward and uncomfortable experience. This design flaw should be addressed to ensure guest convenience and safety.
Unfortunately, the lack of soundproofing in the hotel was a significant issue. Being located at the top of the first stairs, I could hear late-night check-ins from the reception area, and even the sound of people breathing outside my door. This lack of sound insulation made it difficult to have a peaceful and restful night's sleep.
Despite these shortcomings, I must acknowledge that the hotel's location was conveniently situated and free from excessive external noise. The area seemed relatively safe, which was a positive aspect of my stay.
I regret to say that I would not recommend this hotel based on my experience. While it served its purpose for a one-night stay, the small and poorly maintained room, lack of cleanliness, & soundproofing issues overshadowed any positive aspects.Rooms1.0Service4.0Location4.0Report review",1
